# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, I created a map that visualizes earthquake data by using mapbox and leaflet.

The circle markers on the map reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.  If you want to see more information about the earthquake, click the marker and more information will pop up!
